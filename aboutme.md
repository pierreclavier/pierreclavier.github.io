Hello ! I am a Research Scientist, working at [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) on Reinforcement Learning applied to Large Language Models. Before this, I was a PhD candidate in Machine Learning, working at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) in [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) supervised by [Stéphanie Allassonnière](https://sites.google.com/site/stephanieallassonniere/), [Erwan Le Pennec](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~lepennec/fr/) and working closely with [Matthieu Geist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ectPLEUAAAAJ&hl=fr). I was also part of [HeKA](https://team.inria.fr/heka/) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr) Paris.  I graduated from a Master in Mathematics and Machine Learning at [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) in [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/). From January to March 2024, I was a visiting researcher at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) in  the Computing + Mathematical Sciences Department, supervised by [Adam Wierman](https://adamwierman.com/) and [Eric Mazumdar](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~mazumdar/).

My PhD thesis (available [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04956954/)) focused on trying to Robustify  **Reinforcement Learning**. Moreover, I have a great interest currently in :
- **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback**
- **Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward** 
- **Bandit theory**
- **Sampling in general**
